# Kitbot2025
Hello from FRC team 5933, this is the code for our 2025 kitbot (Reefscape).
We are making many changes to the code at this time, which may make it confusing.
(We are also using this to train our software members)
Our goal is to make it more interactive with people, specifically at festivals and school visits.
Thank you for your continued patience as we continue to help this bot to evolve with our team and it's needs.
