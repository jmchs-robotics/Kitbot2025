# Kitbot2025
Basically our side quest
As programmers, none of us know how to actually program.
Most of our code either came with the original kitbot code or was ripped from our old robots.
The rest was stolen from other people who also probably stole the code first.
That's just how programing works.
Seriously, ask any programmer.
